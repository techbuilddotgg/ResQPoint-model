By using Sentinel-2 imagery, you can classify water bodies, vegetation, and urban areas, which is critical for identifying abnormal water expansions and flood impacts. The app could display real-time maps, with blue indicating flooded zones, while green highlights affected vegetation and red marks urban areas. This integration would allow your app to monitor flooding events, prioritize evacuation, and improve disaster response. Additionally, historical flood data from Sentinel-2 could enhance your app’s predictive capabilities, providing valuable insights for future events.",

    "2.063868631125:\n",

    "The values represent the degree of association of a specific pixel to urban, vegetation, and water classes, with higher values showing a stronger match to that class. For example, if this result came from a specific pixel in a satellite image, the area is most strongly classified as urban, followed by vegetation, with the least association to water."
